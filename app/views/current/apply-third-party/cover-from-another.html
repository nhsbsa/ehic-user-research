            An S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate issued by an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland for a person living in the UK entitles them to access the NHS in the same way as a UK resident. You may be entitled to one of these certificates if you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              receive a qualifying benefit or state pension from one of the above countries, and do not receive a UK State Pension

            </li>

              are assessed by the issuing country that you are entitled to a certificate for another reason

              are the family member of someone who has been awarded an S1, E121 or E106 certificate

            <li>
              are entitled to an S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate even if one has not been issued to you

            <li>
              have an S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate which is registered with the NHS

          <p>
            You will need to ask the country who issued this certificate for healthcare cover, such as an EHIC, if you intend to visit another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.
