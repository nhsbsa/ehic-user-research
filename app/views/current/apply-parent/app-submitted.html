        <p>Thank you for submitting your application for a <strong>Provisonal Replacement Certificate</strong> on behalf of {{ data['child-firstname'] }} {{ data['child-lastname'] }}.</p>

        <!-- <p>We have sent a confirmation email to <strong>{{ data['your-email-address'] }}</strong> to let you know that we have received your application. It can take a few minutes for the email to arrive. If it doesn't arrive in 24 hours, check your spam or junk folder. -->

        <h2>What happens next</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>We'll check your entitlement using the details you've given us in your application.</li>
          <li>We'll run a check to confirm your child's residency in the UK. This is not an identity check or a credit check, and it will not affect their credit score.</li>
          <li>If the application is successful, we'll email the PRC to the treatment facilities so they can calculate which costs can be covered.</li>
          <li>If we need more information to help with your application, we may email you to ask for evidence.</li>
          <li>It should only take a few minutes for this email to arrive, but it may take up to 24 hours. You may need to check your spam or junk folder.</li>
        </ul>  

        <h2>What a PRC covers</h2>

        <p>If {{ data['child-firstname'] }} {{ data['child-lastname'] }} is eligible for a PRC, it will provide the same cover as what would normally be covered by an existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC), or UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC).</p>
        <p>This means that they'd be covered for emergency treatment costs as if they were a resident of that country.</p>

        <h3>What it does not cover</h3>

        <p>Most treatment costs are covered by a PRC, but there are some exceptions. </p>
        <p>In some countries, a resident of that country may have to pay towards the cost of their treatment. This is known as a co-payment or a patient contribution. This means that you may need to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS.</p>
        <p>These payments are typically for services like GP or dentist consultations, prescriptions, or hospital stays. </p>
        <p>Depending on the country of treatment, you may need to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS. You may still receive an invoice for a co-payment if you've not paid one.  </p>
        <p>For more information on travelling in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, including what a PRC covers in the country you're visiting, check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">guidance on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

          <p>A PRC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs.</p>
