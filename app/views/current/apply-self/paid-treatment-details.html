          <p>Not all state healthcare is free in other countries.</p>
          <p>In some countries, a resident of that country may have to pay a co-payment, also known as a patient contribution, towards the cost of their treatment. This means that you may need to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS.</p>
          <p>These payments are typically for services like GP or dentist consultations, prescriptions, or hospital stays.</p>
          <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthcare-in-the-eu-norway-iceland-liechtenstein-and-switzerland\" target=\"_blank\">Check the Foreign Office country guides on GOV.UK for information on how to access treatment in the country youâ€™re visiting and what may be required</a></p>
          <p>You cannot apply for a refund for a co-payment. You can only claim a refund for costs which would have been covered by a UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), or Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC).</p>
