      <h2 class="heading-medium">Coverage for quarantine hotels in the EU</h2>

      <p>Some EU countries require foreign visitors, including UK residents, to stay in quarantine hotels if they either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and have no or mild symptoms</li>
        <li>are close contacts of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The costs of quarantine hotels are not covered by an EHIC or GHIC, as the UK considers these hotels to be a public health measure, not medically necessary state-provided healthcare.</p>

      <p>If you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK Government will fund treatment as usual for UK residents or insured individuals. Use your EHIC or GHIC card, or contact the NHS Business Services Authority to receive a Provisional Replacement Certificate if you do not have a valid card.</p>

      <p>EHIC has only ever covered emergency and necessary healthcare costs, so it is always recommended that you take out comprehensive travel insurance, including health cover, when you travel abroad.</p>

      <!------------------------------------->

      <!-- <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</li>
        <li>UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who can apply for a UK GHIC</h2>

      <p>You can apply for a UK GHIC if you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>live in the UK</li>
        <li>normally live in the UK but are studying in the EU</li>
        <li>live in the EU and have been issued with a UK S1 or A1 document</li>
        <li>are an eligible family member or dependant of one of the above</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who can apply for a UK EHIC</h2>

      <p>You can apply for the new UK EHIC if you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You may be able to apply if you are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          an EU, Swiss, Norwegian, Icelandic or Liechtenstein citizen, and you've been living in the UK since before 1 January 2021 however you may not be eligible if you are also a UK national or if you were born in the UK
        </li>
        <li>
          a UK State Pensioner or receiving other exportable benefits since before 1 January 2021 and you have a registered S1 form or E121
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          an eligible family member or dependant of one of the above
        </li>
      </ul>


      

      <h2>What can I use my card for</h2>

      <p>You can use a UK GHIC or UK EHIC to get state provided medically necessary healthcare when you’re visiting an EU country.</p> 
      <p>This includes things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>emergency treatment and visits to A&E</li>
        <li>treatment for a long-term, or pre-existing medical conditions</li>
        <li>routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring</li>
        <li>routine maternity care, as long as you're not going <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/giving-birth-outside-the-uk/">abroad to give birth</a></li>
        <li>oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Medically necessary healthcare means healthcare which becomes needed during your stay, and you cannot reasonably wait until you come back to UK to receive the treatment.
      </p> 
      <p>You’ll need to pre-arrange some treatments with the relevant healthcare provider in the country you are visiting, for example kidney dialysis or chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Not all state healthcare is free in the EU and you may have to pay for services that you’d get for free on the NHS.</p>

      <h2>Where can I use my card</h2>

      <p>A UK EHIC covers you whilst temporarily staying in an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland.</p>
      <p>A UK GHIC only covers you whilst temporarily staying in an EU country, it doesn’t cover you while staying in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The EU countries are:</p>
      <p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.</p>

Once your current card expires, you’ll need to apply for a new card.</p><p>You can apply for a new card up to 6 months before your current card expires. </p>"
      }) }}

      <p>You may be asked to provide further evidence to support your application. Applying takes around 5 minutes.</p>



      <p>A UK GHIC or UK EHIC is free of charge. Beware of unofficial websites, they may charge you a fee to apply.</p>
      <p>It’s currently taking longer than usual to process new UK EHICs due to high demand. We’re working to resolve this and will process all applications as soon as possible.</p>

      <h2>Arrange travel insurance</h2>
      <p>Your UK EHIC or UK GHIC card is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. Make sure you have travel insurance as well as an UK EHIC or UK GHIC.</p>

      <h2>If you are abroad and do not have your card with you</h2>
      <p>You can get a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) to prove your entitlement to medically necessary healthcare if you travel to Europe without your UK GHIC or UK EHIC and need treatment during your visit.</p>

      <p>If you need it outside opening hours, you should call as soon as possible the next working day.</p>
      <p>The PRC will give you the same cover as an UK EHIC or UK GHIC until you return home.</p>
      <p>When calling for a PRC, you'll need to give:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>your National Insurance number</li>
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your address</li>
        <li>your date of birth</li>
        <li>the name of the treatment facility</li>
        <li>the email address for the specific department of the organisation providing your treatment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To apply for a PRC <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us">contact the Overseas Healthcare Services</a>.</p>
      <p>Someone else can apply for a PRC on your behalf.</p>

      <h2>Claiming a refund</h2>
      <p>Depending on the country you visit you may be expected to pay all or part of your bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.</p> 
      <p>Some countries ask patients to pay a contribution towards the cost of their care, such as for prescription costs. This is known as a co-payment or patient share.</p>
      <p>You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the patient share, but the actual patient share is not refundable.</p>
      <p>Keep all receipts and any paperwork, you or your insurance company may need them if you're applying for a refund.</p> -->
