          <h3>How to use your card</h3>
          <p>You can use your card to access medically necessary state-provided healthcare when you're visiting an EU country or Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Medically necessary healthcare means healthcare that cannot reasonably wait until you come back to the UK. Whether treatment is necessary is decided by the healthcare provider in the country you're visiting.</p>
          <p>Medically necessary healthcare includes things like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              emergency treatment and visits to A&E
            </li>
            <li>
              treatment for a long-term or pre-existing medical condition
            </li>
            <li>
              routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring
            </li>
            <li>
              routine maternity care, as long as you're not <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/giving-birth-outside-the-uk/">going abroad to give birth</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>You'll need to pre-arrange some treatments with the relevant healthcare provider in the country you're visiting - for example, kidney dialysis or chemotherapy.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthcare-in-the-eu-norway-iceland-liechtenstein-and-switzerland">Check the Foreign Office country guides on GOV.UK for information on how to access treatment in the country you're visiting</a></p>
          <p>Not all state healthcare is free within the EU and Switzerland and so you may have to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS.</p>

              <p>Your EHIC or GHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. Make sure you have travel insurance as well as your card.</p>

          <h3>Coverage for quarantine hotels in the EU</h3>
          <p>Some EU countries require foreign visitors, including UK residents, to stay in quarantine hotels if they either:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and have no or mild symptoms
            </li>
            <li>
              are close contacts of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19
            </li>
          </ul>
     
          <p>The costs of quarantine hotels are not covered by an EHIC or GHIC, as the UK considers these hotels to be a public health measure, not medically necessary state-provided healthcare.</p>
          <p>If you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK Government will fund treatment as usual for UK residents or insured individuals. Use your EHIC or GHIC card, or contact the NHS Business Services Authority to receive a Provisional Replacement Certificate if you do not have a valid card.</p>
          <p>EHIC has only ever covered emergency and necessary healthcare costs, so it is always recommended that you take out comprehensive travel insurance, including health cover, when you travel abroad.</p>

          <p>It's important that you keep documents relating to your treatment. The Overseas Healthcare Services at the NHSBSA may ask you for more information to check your eligibility and the cost of the treatment you had. This could include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>receipts or invoices relating to treatment</li>
            <li>confirmation of payments made to healthcare institutions</li>

            <li>discharge documents</li>
          </ul>
     
          <p>They'll look at your claim to decide whether you were charged when you should have been covered. If they determine that your treatment should have been covered by the UK GHIC, new UK EHIC or existing EHIC, they’ll reimburse you or your insurer for the costs of treatment which are covered by your card. This may not include the full cost of treatment.</p>
