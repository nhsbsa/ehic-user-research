            An S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate issued by an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland for a person living in the UK entitles them to access the NHS in the same way as a UK resident. You may be entitled to one of these certificates if you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              receive a qualifying benefit or state pension from one of the above countries, and do not receive a UK State Pension
            </li>
            <li>
              are a frontier worker (someone who lives in the UK and works in one of those countries)
            </li>
            <li>
              are assessed by the issuing country that you are entitled to a certificate for another reason
            </li>
            <li>
              are the family member of someone who has been awarded an S1, E121 or E106 certificate
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Answer yes if you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              are entitled to an S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate even if one has not been issued to you
            </li>
            <li>
              have been provided with an S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate that you have not yet registered with the NHS 
            </li>
            <li>
              have an S1, E121, E106 or E109 certificate which is registered with the NHS
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You will need to ask the country who issued this certificate for healthcare cover, such as an EHIC, if you intend to visit another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.
          </p>

          <p>
            If your certificate has not been registered with the NHS, you should send it to:
