        You cannot use this service to apply for a PRC as you've told us that you've paid more than a co-payment or patient contribution for your treatment.
      </p>

      <p>You need to pay the full amount of treatment costs and then claim a refund.</p>

      <h2>Claiming a refund</h2>

      <p>Depending on the country you visit you may be expected to pay all or part of your bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.</p>
      <!-- <p>Some countries ask patients to pay a contribution towards the cost of their care, such as for prescription costs. This is known as a co-payment or patient share.</p> -->
      <p>You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the actual co-payment is not refundable.</p>
      <p>You should keep all invoices, receipts, and any other paperwork. You or your insurance company may need them if you apply for a refund.</p>

        "text": "I cannot afford to pay the rest of my treatment",
