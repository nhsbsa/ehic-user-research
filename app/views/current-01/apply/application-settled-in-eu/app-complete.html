          <p>We will now review your application.</p>

          <p>To check your eligibility for a new UK EHIC, we need to check your EU settled or pre-settled status, as well as your UK residency. This is not a credit check and will not affect your credit score in any way.</p>
           
          <p>If you added any dependants to your application, we will also make the necessary checks to confirm they are eligible.</p>
           
          <p>Once we have done this, we will process your application.</p>
           
          <p>
          <!-- If you gave us an email address, w -->
          We will email you and let you know if your application has been successful or not. If we require any further information, both for yourself and any dependants you have added, we will contact you and let you know what we need.</p>
             
          <!-- <p>If you did not give us an email address, we will contact you by post.</p> -->
           
          <p>Once all the information we need has been accepted, most customers receive their EHIC within 15 working days.</p>
