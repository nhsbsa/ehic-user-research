      <h1>EHIC from 1 January 2021</h1>

      <p>Under the UK’s EU Withdrawal Agreement, certain people are eligible for a new UK EHIC.</p>
      <p>You can use this service to apply for a new UK EHIC if you are in any of these groups:</p>

          <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
            <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
              Nationals of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland who are ordinarily resident in the UK on or before 31 December 2020.
            </span>
          </summary>

          <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
            
            <p>If you are a national of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland and ordinarily resident in the UK on or before 31 December 2020, you may be eligible to apply for an EHIC.</p>

            <p>If you are eligible, you can also use this service to add any spouse or civil partner, durable partner, and children that meet the eligibility conditions:</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Spouse or civil partner</h5>

            <p>Your spouse or civil partner must live in the UK, an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Durable partner</h5>

            <p>A durable partner is someone you have been living together in a relationship similar to a marriage for at least two years, or you have a child with them, and you meet all of the following conditions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>You intend to live together permanently.</li>
              <li>You are not blood relatives.</li>
              <li>Any previous marriage or other similar relationship by either you or your partner has permanently broken down.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can add a durable partner if they are a non-UK citizen and meet some other conditions about their nationality or residence.</p>

            <p>If they are a national of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland they can be added if:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>they arrive in the UK after 31 December 2020 - if they arrived before this, they should apply themselves and</li>
              <li>your relationship began on or before 31 December 2020</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If they are a national of another country, these conditions also apply unless they have settled or pre-settled status under the European Union Settlement Scheme (EUSS), in which case we will just have to verify their residency.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Children</h5>

            <p>You can add a child if they are yours or your partner’s and meet conditions about their age and residency.</p>
            <p>They are eligible if they live in the UK and are under 18 or, if older, you declare they are dependent on you.</p>
            <p>If the child is over 18 but not dependent on you, they can still be added if they:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>are a non-UK national</li>
              <li>reside in the UK</li>
              <li>were born on or after 1 January 2000</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Non-dependent children born before 1 January 2000, who are nationals of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein and resident in the UK before 1 January 2021, should apply for an EHIC themselves.</p>
            <p>Children who live in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland may also be eligible if you have a UK-issued S1.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">What is an S1, E121, E106 and E109 form?</h5>

            <p>An S1 form (previously known as an E121, E106 and E109) is a healthcare certificate that entitles the holder and any dependants to healthcare in another EU country, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, on the same basis as a resident of that country.</p>
            
            <p>You can apply now for a new UK EHIC if you have a registered S1, E121, E106 or E109 form and you are either:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>receiving a qualifying pension or benefit</li>
              <li>a family member (a dependant) of someone with a qualifying pension or benefit</li>
              <li>a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another) who started working in the host state on or before 31 December 2020 (this will be for as long as you continue to be a frontier worker in the host state)</li>
              <li>a family member of a frontier worker</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An EHIC is for healthcare when you travel. You only need to apply for a new card if you have an S1, E121, E106 or E109 and are planning to visit another EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein.</p>

            <p>This also applies to nationals of other countries outside the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland who meet these conditions and have paid, or are exempt from paying, the Immigration Health Surcharge.</p>

            <p>If you are an eligible student studying in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, you can use your EHIC to get medically necessary, state-provided healthcare within the country you are studying.</p>

            <p>You will only be able to use your EHIC in the country you were studying in prior to 1 January 2021 and only while you continue studying there. This country will be identified on the card.</p>
